# CincyTwitterStream

This is a simple Python program to stream tweets about Cincinnati. Currently I'm collecting the tweet text, user, number of followers, location and date of the tweet, and inserting that into a sqlite database. I'm currently running this on a Raspberry Pi.

The plan is to do some sort of sentiment analysis with the data. I'll probably also make some visualizations once I collect enough data.
